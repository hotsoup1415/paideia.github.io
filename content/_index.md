        If you are interested in competition physics, I highly suggest reading Kevin Zhou's <a href="https://knzhou.github.io/writing/Advice.pdf">preliminary advice file.</a> His handouts for physics olympiad, in particular, are extremely high quality, and are great for developing a deeper understanding of mechanics and E & M even if you are not interested in competitions. If you are interested in research, see my list {{% staticref "uploads/Research_opportunities_list.pdf" "newtab" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}.
