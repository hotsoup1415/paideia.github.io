I am a rising senior at Glenbrook North. Ever since I read through my first physics textbook in seventh grade for science bowl, I’ve been captivated by the magic of the subject. Though I’ve explored it extensively through competitions and research, I actually never took any high school physics classes outside of freshman year, when it was mandatory. With the help of online resources, though, I was able to self-study the AP Physics I, Physics C Mechanics, and Physics C Electricity and Magnetism exams all in one year, and practically for free. If you’re a high school student interested in physics but your institution doesn’t offer these classes, I highly recommend trying to self-study these tests - at worst, you’ll be able to learn real physics without the drawbacks of a restrictive, arbitrary curriculum.

It always annoys me when I see scummy professors or undergrads trying to sell ridiculously expensive “prep courses” that claim to guarantee good results. One of my goals has always been to share my love for physics with anybody that would listen, regardless of pay. I hope that this website will help other physics students explore their love for this wonderful subject through online resources, and help smash the socioeconomic divides in education in the process.

Note: website has recently been migrated from Wix. Some materials (detailed information on camps + internships) are in the process of being transferred.
